Description: Implements a data pond pattern for managing immutable research data
    in R projects. The package provides helpers for ingesting raw CSV and XLSX
    files into append-only storage, recording metadata, generating stable logical
    pointers ("views"), and resolving the current version of a dataset without
    hard-coding file paths. It is designed for reproducible analytical workflows
    used in British Columbia government projects.
